Since there are 30 subjects for each treatment, \\(j\\) ranges from 1 to 30.\nApplying a one-way ANOVA to this study, we have the null hypothesis that the effect of human mosquito contact, represented by α, is equal for each of the factors. This is formally written as follows. \\[ H_0:\\alpha_\\text{Odomos} = \\alpha_\\text{Deltamethrin} = \\alpha_\\text{Cyfluthrin} = \\alpha_\\text{D+O} = \\alpha_\\text{C+O} = 0 \\] The alternative hypothesis states that at least one of the effects due to material is different than zero \\[ H_a: \\text{at least one } \\alpha \\text{ is different than 0} \\] Using these hypotheses will allow for us to address the question whether any of the materials are better at minimizing mosquito-human contact.\n\nHypothesis test\nWe will use a level of significance of α = 0.05 for the analysis.\nFor the analysis, we perform the following one-way ANOVA\n\n\nCode\nmosquito <- mosquito %>% \n   mutate(\n         Treatment = case_when(\n           trt.mosq %in% 1  ~ \"Odomos\",\n           trt.mosq %in% 2  ~ \"Deltamethrin\",\n           trt.mosq %in% 3  ~ \"Cyfluthrin\",\n           trt.mosq %in% 4  ~ \"D+O\",\n           trt.mosq %in% 5  ~ \"C+O\"\n          )\n        )\n\nmosquito.aov <- aov(y.mosq ~ Treatment, data=mosquito)\nsummary(mosquito.aov) %>% pander()\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n4\n184.6\n46.16\n4.48\n0.001924\n\n\nResiduals\n145\n1494\n10.3\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value for this test is significant (p = 0.001924).

This is shown by the residual versus fitted plot, which shows roughly a constant variance within each vertical group of dots.

The lowest mean came from the C+O material where the average amount of mosquito/human contact was 5.367. With a mean of 6.333, D+O was not significantly different than C+O and could also be an option. Conducting a new experiment that focuses on the difference between C+O and D+O and gives them a larger sample size in order to better detect significant would be reasonable.\nA future study could look into other types of material as well as doing this analysis at different locations throughout the world."
