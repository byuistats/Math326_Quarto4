# Nested Factor Structure
In this section you will learn how to identify levels of experimental units within a nested factorial design and how to appropriately analyze them. To identify and analyze a nested design appropriately, you will need to have a solid understanding of:

* Experimental units
* True replication
* Fixed effects
* Random effects
* Independence of observations

# Identifying and Diagraming Nested Factors

### Experimental Units

To begin, consider an example from agriculture where a researcher would like to compare yield for a specific variety of maize under different growing conditions:  20 inch row spacing vs 30 inch row spacing.  The farmer has 2 plots of land, side-by-side, on which he plants the maize with different row widths as shown below.
