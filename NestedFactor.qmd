# Overview

This section will describe how to set up and analyze factorial designs with 2 levels of experimental units. This situation occurs when one level of the experiment cannot be easily randomized because of physical constraints. These types of studies are common in agriculture, psychology and laboratory experiments. 

We introduce the concept of nested experimental designs with a Split-Plot design common in agriculture. We conclude this chapter with a discussion about other versions of nested designs and why different terminologies arise in different contexts.  

A split-plot design consists of a **whole-plot** factor and a **Sub-plot** factor.

Because of the physical limitation of randomization, whole-plot factors often have limited replications compared to the subplot factor. To analyze these designs appropriately, it is necessary to account for the fact that each level of experimental unit has different levels of replication. It requires 2 separate error terms to test each level of experimental unit.

Consider 2 examples:

1.  A researcher wants to test the impact of humidity, fungicide and their interaction on tomato yield in greenhouses. Because it is impossible to randomly assign humidity levels within a section of greenhouse, greenhouse would be one level of experimental unit (whole-plot) and fertilizer treatment randomly assigned within a greenhouse would be another level of experimental unit (sub-plot).

2.  A lab manager would like to test the impact of freezer temperature on the life cycle of certain reagents. It is impossible to randomly assign temperature within a given freezer. To get replications of the whole-plot, we would need to have 2 or more freezers set at the same temperature level to get true replications of the whole-plot factor. We could replicate reagent (sub-plot factor) within freezers.

## Nested Factor Designs

Review the discussion on [nested subsample](Nested_Samples.qmd). It will be critical to recognizing the challenge of appropriately analyzing a nested design.

In this chapter you will learn how to identify levels of experimental units within a nested factorial design and its appropriate analysis. To identify and analyze a nested design, you will need to have a solid understanding of:

-   Experimental units
-   True replication
-   Degrees of Freedom for Error

## Motivating Example

Consider an example from agriculture. Farmer John would like to compare yield for a specific variety of maize treated with 2 different fungicides: generic vs premium. Farmer John learned about the importance of independent applications of the experimental levels and gets his neighbor, Farmer Maggot, to participate. Their design is a basic [single factor design](BasicFactorial_intro.qmd) with 2 replicates:

Farmer John could still be interested in the within-field variation and takes sub-samples within a each experimental unit and measures yield at each sample point:

| Maggot |         3 | A         | 514.25 |
| Maggot |         4 | A         | 515.97 |
|    ... |       ... | ...       |    ... |
| Maggot |         1 | B         | 524.31 |
| Maggot |         2 | B         | 519.22 |
| Maggot |         3 | B         |  503.7 |
| Maggot |         4 | B         | 498.67 |
|    ... |       ... | ...       |    ... |

```
Because the treatments are replicated, we can analyze this model as we did in [Nested Subsamples](Nested_Samples.qmd):

We would need to include the sub-sample term in the model to preserve the appropriate degrees of freedom for error for our whole-plot. In this example, we have N = 4 experimental units and k = 2 levels of the experiment, leaving us with N-k = 2 degrees of freedom for testing Fungicide efficacy.

### Adding a Nested Factor

Suppose Farmer John suspects that the impact of fungicide type is different for varieties of maize. We could add 3 maize varieties to the experiment, but because of mechanical constraints we cannot completely randomize Fungicide by Variety treatment combinations. We're still stuck spraying half the field with Fungicide A and the other with Fungicide B.

![](images/FarmerJohnsSplitPlot.png){#fig-block-sort fig-align="center" width="360"}

Hopefully you can spot the challenge. Nothing has changed for the fungicide treatment level. If the variety plots are harvested separately, variety is just a sub-sample within Fungicide treatment. We actually have 2 levels of experimental units!

![](images/FarmerJohnsSplitPlotAnnotated.png){#fig-block-sort fig-align="center" width="615"}

With 2 levels of experimental units, we need 2 separate error terms each with the appropriate degrees of freedom for error (related to the number of true replications for each experimental unit).

Ignoring Variety for a moment, you can see that the Residual error for Fungicide should be estimated by how the larger experimental units vary. It's the Field-to-Field variation.

If we treat Fungicide treatments as blocks, then the residual error for Variety will be the variety-plot-to-variety-plot variation within the [blocks](block_intro.qmd).

# Factor Structor

A split-plot design is characterized by at least 2 levels of experimental units. The larger experimental unit is called the **Whole-plot factor**, and the lower-level experimental unit is called the **split-plot factor**.

In a simple split-plot design, **whole-plots act as Blocking variables** for the split-plots and **split-plots act as sub-samples** for the whole-plots. In fact, the factor structure for a simple split-plot design is identical to a [complete block design](cb1.qmd) if blocks are treated as replicates of the whole-plot.

![](images/Split_Plot_Factor_Image.png){#fig-block-sort fig-align="left" width="950" height="220"}

# Hypothesis and Model

Recall model for a complete block design @eq-cb1:

$$
y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$ {#eq-cb1}

Here $\alpha_i$ is the block to block variation. In a CB[1], block is a nuisance factor and not of particular interest. However, in the split plot design, the addition of the whole-plot-level parameter serves as the error term to test the whole-plot factor.

We can re-imaging the blocking factor ($\alpha_i$ in the CB[1]) as the appropriate error term for the whole-plot. In the above Example, Fungicides are applied to Fields, so the field-to-field variation is the correct error term to use to test Fungicide. The Residual error will still be used as the error term for the sub-plot factor. 

$$
y_{iujt} = \mu + \gamma_i + \epsilon_{i(u)}^{W}  + \beta_j + (\gamma \beta)_{ij} + \epsilon_{jt(iu)}^{S}
$$ {#eq-cb1}

Where

-   $y_{ijut}$ is the observation that belongs to level *i* of $\gamma$, level *j* of $\beta$, the *u* whole-plot experimental unit, and the *t* subplot experimental unit.

-   $\mu$ is the grand mean of all yield data.

-   $\gamma$ is the whole-plot effect, and *i* goes from 1 to 2 because there are 2 levels of fungicide.

-   $\epsilon_{i(u)}^{W}$ is the error term for the whole-plot and represents the variation across the *u* replicates of the whole-plot.

-   $\beta$ is the effect of variety, and *j* goes from 1 to 3 because there are 3 varieties being tested.

-   $(\gamma \beta)_{ij}$ represents the interaction between fungicide and variety.

-   $\epsilon_{jt(iu)}^{S}$ is the residual error term and is used to test the subplot factor and the interaction.

An hypothesis for the main effect of fungicide type:

$$H_0: \alpha_\text{i} = 0 \text{ for all } i$$

$$H_a: \alpha_\text{i} \ne 0 \text{ for some } i$$

An hypothesis for the main effect of variety:

$$H_0: \beta_\text{j} = 0 \text{ for all } j$$

$$H_a: \beta_\text{j} \ne 0 \text{ for some } j$$

An hypothesis for the interaction of fungicide and variety.

$$
H_0: (\alpha\gamma)_\text{ij} = 0 \text{ for all } ij
$$

$$
H_a: (\alpha\beta)_\text{ij} \ne 0 \text{ for some } ij
$$

# Split-Plot Analysis in R

```         
dat <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\paulccannon\\OneDrive - BYU-Idaho\\M326\\Split_Plot_Fake.csv")
dat$Farmer <- as.factor(dat$Farmer)
dat$Variety <- as.factor(dat$Variety)
dat$Fungicide <- as.factor(dat$Fungicide)


## Using AOV
aovout <- aov(Yield ~ Fungicide + Error(Field) + Variety + Variety:Fungicide, data = dat)
summary(aovout)

```

Generally, the model will look like:

```         
aov(Y ~ Whole.Plot + Error(WP.Experimental_Unit) + Split.Plot + Whole.Plot:Split.Plot, data = data)

# or

lmer(Y ~ Whole.Plot:Split.Plot + (Whole.Plot|WP.Experimental_Unit), data = data)
```


# Other Nested Designs

We have introduced nested designs using a Split-Plot design from agriculture because it is an intuitive way to visualize nested structures. In fact, agricultural researchers played a pivotal role in development and proliferation of these methods as is evidenced in the use of the term "split-plot" referring to plots of land. 

However, there are other use cases that follow the same nested structure but thinking in terms of "plots" makes little sense.  Consequently, other disciplines developed their own nomenclature for nested designs. In this section we consider the Repeated Measures design and generic terminology for discussing simple nested designs.

## Repeated Measures

Many experiments are interested in the effect of a treatment over time. These designs often measure subjects within treatment groups at several time points after treatment.  Time is a nested factor measured within-subjects.  Individuals become the blocks for measuring the time effect.  This type of design is called **Repeated Measures**.

In a Repeated Measures design, we do not refer to subjects as whole-plots and repeated measurements across time as sub-plots, though they behave functionally the same in the analysis.  For clarity, we refer to the larger experimental unit (subjects) as the **between-subjects factor** and the factor associated with time point measurements as the **within-subjects factor**. 

The factorization of the Repeated Measures design can be represented (Cobb, 2015) as:

![](images/Repeated_Measures_Factorization_Cobb.png){#fig-block-sort fig-align="left" width="950"}
where CR corresponds to the between-subjects factor and CB refers to the within-blocks factor.  

## Generic Terminology

In some instances, larger experimental units are simply referred to as **blocks**. Treatments assigned to the larger and smaller experimental units are called **between-blocks factor** and **within-blocks factor** respectively. This terminology is complicated by the fact that blocks are not always used for experimental treatments.
