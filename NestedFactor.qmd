# Nested Factor Structure

Review the discussion on [nested subsample](Nested_Subsamples.qmd).  It will be critical to recognizing the challenge of appropriately analyzing a Nested Design.  

In this section you will learn how to identify levels of experimental units within a nested factorial design and how to appropriately analyze them. To identify and analyze a nested design appropriately, you will need to have a solid understanding of:

* Experimental units
* True replication
* Independence of observations
* Degrees of Freedom for Error

# Identifying and Diagraming Nested Factors

### Experimental Units

To begin, consider an example from agriculture Farmer John would like to compare yield for a specific variety of maize treated with 2 different fungicides:  generic vs premium.  Farmer John learned about the importance of independent applications of the experimental levels and gets his neighbor, Farmer Maggot, to participate.  Their design is a basic [single factor design](BasicFactorial_intro.qmd):

Farmer John is could still take subsamples within a each experimental unit:

Where the data would look like 

| Farmer |  Subsample  | Fungicide   |   Yield |
|:-------|------------:|:------------|--------:|
|  John  |     1 | A           |  501.36 |
|  John  |     2 | A           |  507.27 |
|  John  |     3 | A           |  482.3  |
|  John  |     4 | A           |  522.1  |
|  ...   |   ... | ...         |  498.3  |
|  John  |     1 | B           |  487.45 |
|  John  |     2 | B           |  497.86 |
|  John  |     3 | B           |  501.22 |
|  John  |     4 | B           |  499.8  |
|  ...   |   ... | ...         |   ...   |
| Maggot |     1 | A           |  506.45 |
| Maggot |     2 | A           |  536.12 |
| Maggot |     3 | A           |  514.25 |
| Maggot |     4 | A           |  515.97 |
|  ...   |   ... | ...         |   ...   |
| Maggot |     1 | B           |  524.31 |
| Maggot |     2 | B           |  519.22 |
| Maggot |     3 | B           |  503.7  |
| Maggot |     4 | B           |  498.67 |
|  ...   |   ... | ...         |   ...   |


Because the treatments are replicated, we can analyze this model as we did in [Nested Subsamples](Nested_Subsamples.qmd):

$$
y_\text{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \S_\text{j(i)} + \epsilon_\text{ijk}
$$ {#eq-subsample}

Including the subsample term in the model preserves the appropriate degrees of freedom for error.  In this example, we have  N = 4  experimental units and k = 2 levels of the experiment, leaving us with N-k = 2 degrees of freedom for testing Fungicide efficacy.  

## Adding A Nested Factor

Supppose Farmer John suspects that there might be an interaction with the fungicide and different varieties of maize.  We could add 3 different maize varieties to the experiment, but because of mechanical constraints we cannot completely randomize Fungicide by Variety combinations.  We're still stuck spraying half the field with Fungicide A and the other with Fungicide B.

Hopefully you can spot the challenge.  Because nothing has changed for the fungicide treatment level, variety is actually a subsample within treatment.  If fact, we now have 2 levels of experimental units!

We must account for the fact that we donâ€™t have 24 independent applications of fungicide*Variety.  

# Examples

### Freezers as Whole Plots

A lab would like to test the impact of temperature on the life of a their reagents.  They have 4 freezers in the lab with independent climate control.  If we want true replication of temperature control, we would need to pick 2 temperature levels and divide the ...
