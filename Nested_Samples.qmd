## Introduction

### Beware of False Replication

Consider Farmer John who would like to test a name-brand fungicide spray treatment compared with the less expensive, generic import. Fungi can have a severely negative impact on crop yield. Farmer John could plant his field as usual and spray half with fungicide A and half with fungicide B which would look like:

Recall that an Experimental Unit is the object to which a treatment is independently applied. In this case, each plot of land receives the entire application. Replication is an independent repetition of the same conditions on different experimental units. Farmer John's design has no replication.

Now imagine Farmer John's son is visiting home from college and recognizes the problem and comes up with a brilliant solution. He says they can get all the replication they need by sampling from different places within the field and observing the yields at each sampling point. They could get ten "replicates" within each field and analyze the data using standard statistical tools.

Neither a trusting statistician nor statistical software can tell that these data points are not independent applications of the experiment, and therefore not true replication. See the example below:

| "replicate" | Fungicide | Yield  |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:------:|
|      1      |     A     | 501.36 |
|      2      |     A     | 507.27 |
|      3      |     A     | 482.3  |
|      4      |     A     | 522.1  |
|      5      |     A     | 498.3  |
|      6      |     A     | 487.45 |
|      7      |     A     | 497.86 |
|      8      |     A     | 501.22 |
|      9      |     A     | 499.8  |
|     10      |     A     | 442.1  |
|      1      |     B     | 506.45 |
|      2      |     B     | 536.12 |
|      3      |     B     | 514.25 |
|      4      |     B     | 515.97 |
|      5      |     B     | 509.51 |
|      6      |     B     | 524.31 |
|      7      |     B     | 519.22 |
|      8      |     B     | 503.7  |
|      9      |     B     | 498.67 |
|     10      |     B     | 539.04 |

Sub-samples can provide useful information about how yields vary within a plot, but they are not replications of the experiment. It can only provide a false sense of statistical sophistication for a simple anecdote.

If we are not interested in the within-field variation, the easiest thing to do is average over the sub-samples and analyze the experiment in a typical manner.  In the above example it becomes clear that we have no replication and cannot get an F-statistic. 

<!-------------


We can also include Sample "nested within" Treatment in our model, which allows us to estimate within-field variation and preserves the appropriate degrees of freedom for a design.

The model including nested sub-samples can be written:

$$
y_\text{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + S_\text{j(i)} + \epsilon_\text{ijk}
$$ {#eq-subsample}

Where

-   $y_{ijk}$ is the observation that belongs to level *i* of $\alpha$, sub-sample, *j* , and the true replication, *k*.

-   $\mu$ is the grand mean of the entire dataset.

-   $\alpha_i$ is the fungicide level, *i*.

-   $S_\text{j(i)}$ is the sub-sample *j* nested within level *i* of fungicide and is considered a nuisance parameter.



This model only works, though, if you have treatment replications, *k*, otherwise you cannot estimate the error term, $\epsilon_\text{ijk}$.

### Conclusion
--------->

Failure to account for sub-samples is like counterfeiting degrees of freedom. It is important to be able to identify false replication and be able to compare treatments with the appropriate degrees of freedom for error.
